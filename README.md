MData
=====

What is it?
-----------

MData is a kind of DI system that allows the developper to use interfaces of the domain model, rather then the actual implementation.

This has several adavantages:
* Testing and mocking of the domain model is easy now
* AOP can be added very easily, because the concrete types are generated at runtime
* Seperation of the 'property bag' domain class, and the actual logic (methods on this domain class)
